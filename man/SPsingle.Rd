\title{Semiparametric causal mediation analysis for a single mediator}
\usage{
SPsingle(
  dataset,
  treatment,
  mediator,
  outcome,
  covariates = NULL,
  pi.link = "logit",
  rho.link = "identity",
  intercept = TRUE,
  fast = FALSE,
  detail = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A matrix or data frame containing treatment, mediator,
outcome, and covariates.}

\item{treatment}{Character string specifying the column name of the
treatment variable (\eqn{A}).}

\item{mediator}{Character string specifying the column name of the
mediator (\eqn{M}).}

\item{outcome}{Character string specifying the column name of the
outcome (\eqn{Y}).}

\item{covariates}{Optional character vector of column names corresponding
to baseline confounders (\eqn{C}). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{pi.link}{Character string specifying the link function for the
treatment model. Default is \code{"logit"}.}

\item{rho.link}{Character string specifying the link function for the
residual correlation model. Default is \code{"identity"}.}

\item{intercept}{Logical indicator for including an intercept term in
the confounder matrix. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fast}{Logical indicator. If \code{TRUE}, a one-step estimator is
used; otherwise, the estimating equations are solved directly using
nonlinear equation solvers.}

\item{detail}{Logical indicator. If \code{TRUE}, returns additional
variance components.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} containing point estimates and standard errors for:
\itemize{
  \item \code{thetaA}: effect of treatment on outcome,
  \item \code{thetaM}: effect of mediator on outcome,
  \item \code{betaA}: effect of treatment on mediator,
  \item \code{NIE}: natural indirect effect.
}
}
\description{
Fits the proposed semiparametric mediation model for a single mediator
using estimating equations and adaptive bootstrap inference.
}
\details{
The method estimates the treatment effect on the outcome, the effect of
the mediator, and the natural indirect effect (NIE).


The estimator is based on semiparametric estimating equations that jointly
model the treatment, mediator, and outcome processes. Variance estimation
is obtained using the sandwich formula derived from the estimating
equations.

The model is fitted one mediator at a time.
